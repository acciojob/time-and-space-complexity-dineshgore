        In computer science, analyzing the performance of algorithms is crucial to creating efficient solutions for various problems. One fundamental aspect of this analysis is <strong>Time Complexity</strong>. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task in relation to the size of the input. It helps us understand how the algorithm's execution time increases as the input size grows. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient, as it can handle larger inputs without causing significant delays.

        Another essential consideration in algorithm analysis is <strong>Space Complexity</strong>. Space complexity deals with the amount of memory or space an algorithm needs to complete its task based on the input size. This includes the memory required for variables, data structures, and other resources used during execution. Algorithms with better space complexity utilize memory more efficiently, which is particularly important in environments with limited memory resources. A common way to express space complexity is using the notation <strong>O(n)</strong>, where <em>n</em> represents the input size.
