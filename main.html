    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. In simpler terms, time complexity tells us how long it will take for an algorithm to run, given different input sizes. An algorithm with efficient time complexity will execute quickly, even for large inputs.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity is another fundamental concept in computer science, which focuses on analyzing the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, also as a function of the input size. It is often denoted using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> helps us understand how an algorithm consumes memory resources. Efficient algorithms have lower space complexity, which means they use less memory for a given input size.</p>
