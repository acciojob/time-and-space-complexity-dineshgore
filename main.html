    <h1>time,space,complexity</h1>
    <p>time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size.in computer science, we often analyze  algorithms to determine their time complexity. an algorithm is considered<b> efficient </b>if it can solve a problem within a reasonable amount of time,evne for large inputs.understanding time complexity helps us choos the best algorithm for a particular problem bases on its input size.</p>
    <p>space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the efficient utilization of memeory or storage by an algorithm, it is oftne denoted as <b>0(n)</b>,where 
    'n' represents the size of the input.space complexity measures how much additional memory an algorithm requires to complete its task. optimizing space complexi is essential in scenarios where memry resources are limited, such as in embeded systems or when dealing with large datasets.</p>
